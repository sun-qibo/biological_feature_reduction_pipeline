# biological_feature_reduction_pipeline

A feature reduction pipeline designed specifically for biological datasets where interpretability and feature traceability are critical. Unlike standard dimensionality reduction techniques that transform or eliminate features, this pipeline maintains interpretability by:

Preserving correlated features: Retains all features while tracking correlation relationships, enabling researchers to understand which features contribute collectively to model predictions
Flexible abundance filtering: Removes features with extremely low or high presence based on research context (e.g., rare species in microbiome studies, housekeeping genes in transcriptomics)
Feature provenance tracking: Maintains detailed records of which features were grouped, filtered, or retained throughout the reduction process

Ideal for biological ML applications where model explainability and feature attribution are essential for scientific interpretation and validation.
